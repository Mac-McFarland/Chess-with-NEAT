# Chess Game with NEAT AI

This is a chess game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game includes an AI player powered by the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

## Features

- Play a game of chess against the computer AI.
- The AI player is trained using the NEAT algorithm to make intelligent moves.
- Support for basic chess rules, including piece movements and capturing.
- Interactive user interface with graphical representation of the chessboard.
- Ability to save and load game progress.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- NEAT library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-game.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install pygame, pip install neat

## Run the game

- python chess_game.py

    Play the game using the mouse to select and move the pieces. The AI player will make its moves based on the NEAT algorithm.

    Use the following controls:
        Left mouse button: Select and move pieces
        Quit the game by closing the window or pressing the 'X' button

## AI Configuration

    The AI player's behavior can be modified by adjusting the NEAT configuration in the neat-config.txt file. Experiment with different settings to achieve desired AI performance.
